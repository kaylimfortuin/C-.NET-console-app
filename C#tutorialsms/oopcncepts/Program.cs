//oop means object-oriented programming and it is a programming approach that uses objects and classes to structure code.
//principles of oop are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
//classes are blueprints for creating objects, and objects are instances of classes.
//objects can have properties (attributes) and methods (functions).
//examples of classes are Car, Dog, and Person.
//examples of objects are myCar, myDog, and johnDoe.
